My name is Jesse Good and the phrase "Translator by day and coder by night." pretty much sums up my life.
I work full-time doing Japanese-English translation while on the side I spend a lot of time writing C#.

For translation I use Trados Studio 2015. 
You can find me on [SDL Community](https://community.sdl.com/).

I'm also part of the [SDL OpenExchange Program](http://www.translationzone.com/openexchange/developer/)
and hope to write more information on how to develop custom plug-ins for Trados, as currently there is not much information out there.

You might also find me on Stack Overflow sometimes under the C# and C++ tags mainly:
