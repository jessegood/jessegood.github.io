Introducing the MXLIFF (Memsource) file type for Trados Studio 2015. <!--more-->

**NOTE**: You can download the lastest version of the plug-in [from here][pluginpath].

# So what does this file type do?

If you google "MXLIFF Trados", you can find a lot of freelance translators who have clients that work with Memsource,
but would like to do their translations in Trados Studio or memoQ.

Up until now, the common workaround for Trados Studio was to changed the file extension from `.mxliff` to `.xliff`.
However, MXLIFF files use many attributes that other tools do not understand like `m:score` or `m:locked` (all Memsource specific attributes start with an `m:`).

I've developed a plug-in which you can install into Trados Studio 2015 (2014 might also work, but is untested). (See download link above)

If you have any questions, bug reports, etc. please contact me by e-mail or leave a comment.
